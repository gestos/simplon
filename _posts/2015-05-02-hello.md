with the modified rakefile i can easily create empty posts with a timestamp in the filename by typing rake post TITLE='title here'
however, the rakefile is missing an automated detailed timestamp inside the post. 

I took the rakefile from this http://arjanvandergaag.nl/blog/creating-new-jekyll-posts.html site, just had to add *require 'date'* somewhere at the beginning.
