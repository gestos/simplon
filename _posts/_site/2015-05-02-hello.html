<p>with the modified rakefile i can easily create empty posts with a timestamp in the filename by typing rake post TITLE=’title here’
however, the rakefile is missing an automated detailed timestamp inside the post.</p>

<p>I took the rakefile from this http://arjanvandergaag.nl/blog/creating-new-jekyll-posts.html site, just had to add <em>require ‘date’</em> somewhere at the beginning.</p>
