<h2 id="using-vims-internal-file-explorer">Using vim’s internal file explorer</h2>

<p>I’ve seen this on <a href="https://medium.com/@mozhuuuuu/vimmers-you-dont-need-nerdtree-18f627b561c3">this</a> blogpost while looking up some proper keybindings for the NERDtree plugin.<br />
Since I really don’t need anything more than just a simple filebrowser that can be toggled into view, this fits all my needs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>activate the Explorer by type :E in command mode</li>
  <li>type “i” for changing list style or just put <em>let g:netrw_liststyle=3</em> in your .vimrc</li>
  <li>hitting enter on a file will open it in a new buffer (nerdtree seems to open files in new tabs)</li>
  <li>if you just want to leave the explorer view, simply go to the next buffer</li>
  <li>I’ve mapped <em>:E</em> to <em>&lt;ctrl-e&gt;</em> in my .vimrc, although that is only slightly, if at all, more convenient</li>
</ul>
