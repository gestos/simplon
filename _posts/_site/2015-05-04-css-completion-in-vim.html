<p>Turning on completion for css items (like e.g. bluefish has and I was missing it severely in vim) is actually pretty <em>easy</em>!
only :set omnifunc=csscomplete#CompleteCSS and the ctrl-x+ctrl-o will give the possible completions!</p>

<p>see:
https://docs.oseems.com/general/application/vim/auto-complete-css
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Omni_completion</p>

<p>the first one explains it very nicely and has a screenshot, too :-)</p>
