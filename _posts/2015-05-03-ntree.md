If you ever felt the need for a small file browser within vim, check out the Nerdtree plugin.
You can find it here:
https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree
and theres an installation instruction using pathogen, which I followed and worked for me.
Once you call it from inside vim via :NERDTree it will open on the left hand side and is pretty straightforward if you scan the help (press "?") section for some seconds. Great stuff!
